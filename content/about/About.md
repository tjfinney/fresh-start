Fresh Start Recovery Programme grew out of a commitment to help drug users and their families recover from drug dependence. Fresh Start concentrates on detox and developing a drug free lifestyle.

Fresh Start's founder Dr George O'Neil performed his first addiction treatment in 1997. Dr O'Neil was motivated to help the community with its addiction problems while working as an obstetrician. He would deliver babies to mothers addicted to heroin and see their babies born with the addiction who subsequently suffer through withdrawals in the nursery. The final event that hardened resolve and spurred him into action was when a patient asked him to help her husband with his addiction problems so that their family could be happy together.

While initially starting with just one private patient more and more patients were arriving after hearing about Dr O'Neil through word of mouth. As demand for the treatment grew Dr O'Neil set up a clinic which eventually grew into the Fresh Start Recovery Programme of today. Now with the Subiaco clinic, Northam Recovery Centre, and recovery houses spread through the metro area Fresh Start has grown into a comprehensive treatment program with Christian values and a dedication to treat anyone in need.

Our approach to helping people with addictions is based on a model of recovery that emphasises the importance of evidence-based medical intervention, strong relationships, a stable home life, and empowering people to take up a responsible role in their community. Our approach to helping people with addictions is known as the [PHREE model](/about/approach): Physiology, Housing, Relationships, Empowerment, and Exit.

Through our unique and comprehensive approach to addiction treatment we have helped over 9,000 people and their families out of the vicious cycle of addiction.
