Fresh Start’s approach to helping people with addictions is sometimes known as the PHREE model:

* Physiology
* Housing
* Relationships
* Education
* Employment

## Physiology

Our programs treat the physical cravings of drug addiction. Our follow up and other medical services such as our GP Clinic and Hepatitis C program support the general health of patients.

## Housing

Many drug users who come to Fresh Start depend on other users for a place to live. Once they start treatment this is not a suitable arrangement. The most suitable type of housing depends on the stage of recovery. We have a number of facilities and can also refer patients to other facilities.

## Relationships

For many clients, rebuilding broken relationships is essential. We offer counselling, which aims to improve self-esteem and enable the client to start to form healthy relationships and rebuild broken relationships.

## Education

Patients are offered the chance to engage in activities designed to enable them to live a normal lifestyle within the community. They are encouraged to enrol in TAFE and university courses. Many of the patients also choose to take part in a Christian version of ‘The Twelve Steps’.

## Employment

The ultimate aim of our program is that our clients will gain employment. Many have Community Service Orders and some do voluntary work which builds up their practical skills.
