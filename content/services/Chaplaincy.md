Fresh Start has a team of chaplains who, upon request, provide chaplaincy and spiritual care for patients and their families. Our rehabilitation program is based on [Christian beliefs and values](/about/beliefs). It uses a Christian version of ‘The Twelve Steps’ in conjunction with [The Life Recovery Bible](http://liferecoveryproducts.com/).
