Our patients go through several stages in recovery and their accommodation needs can change at each stage. We believe providing these residential facilities helps prevent our clients slipping back into drug use.

## Warwick House

Warwick House is a short term safe environment for patients in acute stages of pre- and post-detoxification and recovery. Twentyfour hour care and medical assistance is provided.

## Transitional Housing

Fresh Start has limited transitional housing available for clients. Participation is determined on a case-by-case basis. We have houses available for men and women.

Our [Northam Recovery Program](/services/rehabilitation) is also available for men.
