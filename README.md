# Fresh Start web site development

This is a development area for a new FreshStart website. See [the existing website](http://www.freshstart.org.au/).

See [Up and running with blogdown](https://apreshill.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) for a guide.

# Create fresh-start repository on GitHub

Use GitHub to create a new `fresh-start` repository with a Readme but nothing else.

# Clone fresh-start repository

`cd ~/Keep/www/freshstart.com.au/mk2`

`git clone https://github.com/tjfinney/fresh-start.git`

There is now a `fresh-start` directory at `~/Keep/www/freshstart.com.au/mk2/fresh-start`.

# Create new R project

Use the top menu buttons in RStudio to select File -> New Project -> Existing Directory, browse to the `fresh-start` directory, then click on the Create Project button.
