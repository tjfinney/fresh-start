	  <h1>Alcohol</h1>




<h2 id="alcohol-harm">Alcohol harm</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/illicit-use-of-drugs/ndshs-2016-detailed/contents/summary">Australian National Drug Strategy Household Survey</a> found that over 80% of the population drinks alcohol. Not all of this is harmful, but 10% of people drink alcohol in a way that risks long-term harm and 21% drink at least once a month in a way that risks short-term harm. Excess alcohol is capable of damaging nearly every organ and system in the body.</p>

<p>Alcohol use is also a major cause of deaths in Australia. In 1998, around 2,000 deaths among people aged 0-64 were attributable to the use of alcohol. The Australian Burden of Disease study estimated that <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/biomedical-risk-factors/risk-factors-to-health/contents/risk-factors-and-disease-burden">5.1% of the total burden of disease</a> in Australia in 2011 was attributable to alcohol consumption.</p>

<h2 id="alcohol-dependence">Alcohol dependence</h2>

<p>The damage caused by an inability to control drinking manifests in many ways. Alcoholism also has significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. Alcoholism has a significant adverse impact on mental health. The risk of suicide among alcoholics has been found to be greater that of the general public. The physical health effects associated with alcohol consumption may include cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, heart disease, increased chance of cancer, nutritional deficiencies, sexual dysfunction, and death from many causes. Approximately 10% of all dementia cases are alcohol-related.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-alcohol-dependent">Are you alcohol dependent?</h2>

<p>The <strong>CAGE</strong> questionnaire is a tool used to assess people for alcohol problems, including dependence. It involves four simple questions. If you answer two or more of these as a yes, you could be alcohol dependent and need to speak to someone about it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you ever feel like you should <strong>Cut down</strong> your drinking?</li>
<li>Do you ever feel <strong>Angry or Annoyed</strong> when people try to talk to you about drinking?</li>
<li>Do you ever feel <strong>Guilty</strong> as a consequence of drinking?</li>
<li>Do you ever need an <strong>Eye opener</strong> &ndash; a drink of alcohol in the morning &ndash; before you can function?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="alcohol-treatment">Alcohol Treatment</h2>

<p>While the effects of alcohol are not directly related to the opiate system, the opioid receptors also detect the body’s own naturally-occurring chemicals such as endorphins. This means the desire to use alcohol and the feeling of reward when it is used can be limited by blocking the opioid receptors with medication. However, our medications do not eliminate the feeling of drunkenness if alcohol is used. Our doctors may also prescribe specific medications for alcohol as part of a relapse prevention program.</p>
